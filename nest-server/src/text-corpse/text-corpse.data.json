    "text": "where are we starting? today is a wednesday in jan. i’m at mutiny cafe and it was a uneventful workday. there is a slight hangover from a moderate exception to my dryuary . last night after pickleball we went to Tavern. Sai went to hug the owner who had rubber gloves and what looked like ground beef on them. he didn’t want to be hugged and told us it was in fact human shit from toilet problems. some younger ratchet girls are singing nü metal karaoke songs, later they are flicking off and mooning some other girls. it takes a minute to decipher that it’s not in jest but whatever. one beer down. i dutifully had not drank up until now nor had i had a cig. well i’m being too verbose. these girls get in a real fight, no good punches land and it’s mostly hair. they aren’t even kicked out. Sai is somewhat amazed and orders me another round, another cat fight happens, sai orders another round and i think we got 3 fights for 5 beers. they finally got kicked out after the 3rd fight but the staff is pretty inept at doing that clearly.",
