          <p>Hi, I am Brendan O'Keefe I do software development for work but this site is for all my side projects, ideas, portfolio.I wish I bought a better domain name but after setting it all up i am probably sticking with it.

            Tech stack deployment nerdery: <br />
            It was hosted on a AWS EC2 instance, now on a simpler digitalocean droplet,
             deployed using a CI/CD pipeline triggered by a GitHub runner. 
             Changes I make are automatically
            deployed about a minute later. Its a monorepo Dockerized Node.js app
            utilizing React on the frontend and Nest framework on the backend. I
            used Pantone's 2025 fashion color trend for the color palette.

          <h1>Me</h1>
          <p>this would be the toot-my-own-🎺horn🎺 section when I am looking for a job. luckily i am not doing that right now. anyone visiting prolly knows me.</p>
          {/* <p>
            I am a very enthused software developer who loves complex problem
            solving and working on innovative teams. I really love the work of
            development and hope to stay coding forever!
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite things about web development are when we can shorten the
            barriers to talking to each other, and uncomplicate systems that
            were previously bureaucratically complex and difficult to navigate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work I concentrate on non-laptop hobbies like playing
            guitar, hiking, fermenting foods, growing plants in my garden and
            hydroponically, or reading first-contact explorer accounts or
            seafaring journals.
